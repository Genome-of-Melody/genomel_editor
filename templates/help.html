        <h1>Annotating with Genomel Editor</h1>
        <p>
            To start annotating with the Genomel Editor, you need to:

            <ul>
                <li>Obtain a user account.
                    (Contact Jan Hajiƒç at the Masaryk Institute and Archives, Czech Academy of Sciences.).
                </li>
                <li>Log in to the editor using the form in the upper area site (header).</li>
                <li>Go to the Annotate page.</li>
                <li>The system will either assign to you a new annotation, or it will
                    load a mellody for you to continue annotating.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Once you are on the annotation page, you have to 1) load the image,
            2) syllabize the text, 3.1) transcribe the melody into Volpiano, or
            3.2) mark the melody as impossible to transcribe (incomplete or adiastematic),
            and 4) save your progress.
        </p>
        <p>
            1) Loading the image:

            <ul>
                <li>In order to load the image from which you are transcribing,
                    <b>you need to copy the image into the clipboard</b> first.</li>
                <li>Go to the image URL that the system provides you with.
                    Some chant databases serve the image directly to your browser
                    (like ispan.pl). In that case, by right-clicking the image
                    in the browser, a context menu comes up that contains the "Copy Image"
                    option. Click that option.
                </li>
                <li>However, some online libraries, such as Gallica or the British National Library,
                    don't allow you to copy the image directly. However, what they do provide
                    is a download option. If you download the image, it opens in a new browser
                    tab as a normal image file. You can then copy it from there using right-click
                    to bring up the context menu and select "Copy Image".
                </li>
                <li>Once the image is copied, switch back to the annotation tab and
                    <b>just press paste: Ctrl+V (or Cmd+V on Mac).</b> The image will paste
                    itself into the image area.</li>
                <li>The image is draggable, and you can use the buttons to zoom
                    in or out if need be. You can also adjust the size of the image
                    area -- it is resizable using the bottom right corner.</li>
                <li>Once you can comfortably see the part of the image that you
                    should be transcribing, you can start working on the Volpiano
                    transcription.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
            2) Syllabizing the text:

            <ul>
                <li>Under the image, you can see the "Syllabized text" field
                    pre-populated with the manuscript text.</li>
                <li>However, the information we donwloaded from Cantus Index
                    does not contain the syllabization of the text. This has
                    to be done manually (at least if you are the first person
                    to be annotating a chant).</li>
                <li><b>Add hyphens ("-") to indicate syllable breaks.</b> Do not add
                    any spacing.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
            3.1) Transcribing the melody:

            <ul>
                <li>Proceed to transcribe the melody into Volpiano according
                    to the <a  target="_blank" href="https://cantusdatabase.org/static/documents/2.%20Volpiano%20Protocols.pdf">
                        Cantus Volpiano Protocols</a> (clicking the link opens a new tab).</li>
                <li>At any point, to check your progress, click the "Render" button.</li>
            </ul>

            3.2) Marking the melody as impossible to transcribe:

            <ul>
                <li>It can happen that the chant comes from an adiastematic source.
                    In that case, do not transcribe anything and check the "Adiastematic"
                    checkbox.</li>
                <li>In other cases, a chant might be recorded in an incomplete form.
                    This most often happens when the chant occurs in the same source
                    earlier, so possibly only the incipit is written down (so that the
                    singers recall the melody, which they would have known by heart anyway).
                    In this case, do not transcribe anything and check the "Incomplete"
                    checkbox.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
            4) Save your work

            <ul>
                <li>In order to save your work in progress, click the "Save" button.
                    The server should let you continue editing. (We retain the image
                    in the browser's storage, so if you cleared your browsing data since last
                    working on the melody, you will have to copy the image again.)</li>
                <li>Once you are done with the melody transcription and text syllabization,
                    make sure you render your transcription and check that the text
                    and melody fit together properly. Then, to mark the transcription
                    as complete, check the "Is transcribed?" checkbox. Then, click "Save".
                    The melody will be moved to the next step of the process: validation.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
